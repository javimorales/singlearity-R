# Welcome to Singlearity!


Singlearity is a web-based service for baseball analytics.  It uses machine learning to make predictions based on a wide range of player and historical data.    These predictions can be used to make more effective pre-game and in-game strategy decisions and to provide for more accurate game simulations.

You can view the technical description of Singlearity at [Baseball Prospectus](https://www.baseballprospectus.com/news/article/59993/singlearity-using-a-neural-network-to-predict-the-outcome-of-plate-appearances/)

# Description

This repository contains sample R code for making programmatic calls to the Singlearity web service hosted at api.singlearity.com.

There are two closely related types of predictions that can be obtained:

* **Batter vs. Pitcher predictions (Singlearity-PA)**.   To generate batter vs. pitcher predictions, you must programmatically generate a **Matchup**.  A Matchup consists of a **Batter**, a **Pitcher**, the **Atmosphere** (containing things such as game location and weather), and a **State** (containing things such as score, inning, and baserunners).  A list of matchups can be submitted to the Singlearity server and it will return predicted outcomes for each matchup.  Visit the [singlearity.com](https://www.singlearity.com) website to see a GUI version of Singlearity-PA.

* **Game simulation predictions (Singlearity-Game)**.   Game simulations work by running hundreds or thousands of Monte Carlo simulations using the plate appearance outcomes provided by Singlearity-PA.   To generate game simulations, you must programmatically create home and away **Lineup**s.   The simulation may optionally include a starting **State** at some intermediate point in the game.  This would allow you to simulate, for instance, a tie game in the bottom of the 9th inning game with multiple runners on base, the #5 hitter coming to bat with a tired pitcher on the mound.   Currently, Singlearity-Game only supports simulating to the end of the half-inning.  With a very short piece of code, you could, for instance, simulate how successful each of ten different relievers would be in holding a lead in the bottom of the 10th inning when facing a given portion of the lineup.    It is possible to accurately simulate hundreds or thousands of games in just a few seconds. 

# Requirements

R 3.3+

## Installation

Obtain a Trial API key through the [Singlearity Contact Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdO_K9_6cGBG_iStuSMKbqUBRX3Z8RAYzNVFRBVIXuumVSjAg/viewform?usp=sf_link)



### Prerequisites

Install the dependencies

```
#R code
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("singlearity-sports/singlearity-R")
```


## Example Usage

**Create it**

Copy ```examples/common.R``` to a local directory.

Create a file ```pa_pred_very_simple.R``` in the same local directory with:

```
#pa_pred_very_simple.R

##########################################
# Make predictions for groups of batters vs groups of pitchers
##########################################
source('common.R')

#list of batters
batter_list = c('Mookie Betts', 'Justin Turner', 'Max Muncy', 'Cody Bellinger')

#list of pitchers
pitcher_list = c('Chris Paddack', 'Emilio Pagan')

#initialize empty lists
candidate_batters <- list()
candidate_pitchers <- list()

for (batter in batter_list)
{
  candidate_batters <- append(candidate_batters, sing$GetPlayers(name=batter))
}

for (pitcher in pitcher_list)
{
  candidate_pitchers <- append(candidate_pitchers, sing$GetPlayers(name=pitcher))
}

venue <- sing$GetVenues(stadium.name = 'Dodger Stadium')[[1]]
atmosphere <- Atmosphere$new(venue = venue, temperature = 70, home_team = sing$GetTeams(name = 'Dodgers')[[1]])

matchups <- list()
for (b in candidate_batters)
{
  for (p in candidate_pitchers)
  {
    matchups <- append(matchups, Matchup$new(batter = b, pitcher = p, atmosphere = atmosphere, state = State$new()))
  }
}

results <- sing$GetPaSim(matchup = matchups)
results <- results[c('batter_name', 'pitcher_name', 'hr_exp', 'so_exp', 'ba_exp', 'ops_exp', 'woba_exp')]
results <- results[order(results$woba_exp, decreasing = TRUE), ]
print(results)
```

**Run it**
```
env SINGLEARITY_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY R -f pa_pred_very_simple.R
```
**Results**
