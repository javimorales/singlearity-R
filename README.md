# Welcome to Singlearity!


Singlearity is a web-based service for baseball analytics.  It uses machine learning to make predictions based on a wide range of player and historical data.    These predictions can be used to make more effective pre-game and in-game strategy decisions and to provide for more accurate game simulations.

You can view the technical description of Singlearity at [Baseball Prospectus](https://www.baseballprospectus.com/news/article/59993/singlearity-using-a-neural-network-to-predict-the-outcome-of-plate-appearances/)

# Description

This repository contains sample R code for making programmatic calls to the Singlearity web service hosted at api.singlearity.com.

There are two closely related types of predictions that can be obtained:

* **Batter vs. Pitcher predictions (Singlearity-PA)**.   To generate batter vs. pitcher predictions, you must programmatically generate a **Matchup**.  A Matchup consists of a **Batter**, a **Pitcher**, the **Atmosphere** (containing things such as game location and weather), and a **State** (containing things such as score, inning, and baserunners).  A list of matchups can be submitted to the Singlearity server and it will return predicted outcomes for each matchup.  Visit the [singlearity.com](https://www.singlearity.com) website to see a GUI version of Singlearity-PA.

* **Game simulation predictions (Singlearity-Game)**.   Game simulations work by running hundreds or thousands of Monte Carlo simulations using the plate appearance outcomes provided by Singlearity-PA.   To generate game simulations, you must programmatically create home and away **Lineup**s.   The simulation may optionally include a starting **State** at some intermediate point in the game.  This would allow you to simulate, for instance, a tie game in the bottom of the 9th inning game with multiple runners on base, the #5 hitter coming to bat with a tired pitcher on the mound.   Currently, Singlearity-Game only supports simulating to the end of the half-inning.  With a very short piece of code, you could, for instance, simulate how successful each of ten different relievers would be in holding a lead in the bottom of the 10th inning when facing a given portion of the lineup.    It is possible to accurately simulate hundreds or thousands of games in just a few seconds.

  for (p in candidate_pitchers)
  {
    matchups <- append(matchups, Matchup$new(batter = b, pitcher = p, atmosphere = atmosphere, state = State$new()))
  }
}

results <- sing$GetPaSim(matchup = matchups)
results <- results[c('batter_name', 'pitcher_name', 'hr_exp', 'so_exp', 'ba_exp', 'ops_exp', 'woba_exp')]
results <- results[order(results$woba_exp, decreasing = TRUE), ]
print(results)
```

**Run it**
```

## Command Line Usage
```examples/cmd_pa_pred.R``` is a command line utility for quickly generating batter vs. pitcher predictions.   It is a "swiss-army knife" for creating matchups with various different options.  The source code can also be examined to view the R code necessary to generate different options.   To run this command line, type:

```cmd_pa_pred.R```      - you will likely need to make this file executable 
or 
```R -f cmd_pa_pred.R```

To see a list of options, type:
 ```cmd_pa_pred.R --help```

This results in:
```Usage: ./cmd_pa_pred.R [options]

**Sample Command Line**
Here is an example of using the command line to generate matchups.
``` ./cmd_pa_pred.R --batters='Joc Pederson, Giancarlo Stanton' --pitchers='Blake Snell, Zack Greinke' --venue='Yankee Stadium' --hometeam='Yankees' --inning=6 --pitchnumber=80 --outs=1 --on2b --temperature=90 --plot=woba```


## Example Visualizations
It is easy to combine the Singlearity prediction outputs with libraries such as ggplot to create visualizations which communicate the important information efficiently.  [Here is an example in R](https://github.com/singlearity-sports/singlearity-R/blob/master/examples/wOBA_by_pitch_count.R "Here is an example") showing each batter's expected wOBA as Max Scherzer's pitch count increases.

It is also easy to create visualizations which efficiently represent the data needed to make player substitutions.   [Here is an example in R](https://github.com/singlearity-sports/singlearity-R/blob/master/examples/batters_vs_pitchers.R "Here is an example in R") showing the predicted wOBA for each Dodgers batter vs. each Padres pitcher.  These predictions and their visualizations take only a few seconds to produce.
