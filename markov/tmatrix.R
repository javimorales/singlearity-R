# Standard function (passing in values explicitly)
# Inputs:
# 21 different event probabilities
# Defaults are overall league averages for the 2020 season, as of 9/24/20
# Probs. are generally just # occurrences / # situations
# Situation-dependent ones are restricted to states where it's actually possible
# i.e., the PA denominator is not the same for TP as for SO
# For errors, the denominator is number of chances
